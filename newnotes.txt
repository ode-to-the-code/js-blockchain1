coinbase transaction 
it's a part of our fundamental block 

what does a cb do?
it tells us how much money the miner who successfully solves the block should receive 

when does the miner get their reward for mining the block?
in bitcoin, in ethereum, and in the Anders demo it's when the block is mined. (not in the next 
block, that's just in our implementation). That's why it would be useful to try to change our 
demo to that way


hw-
try and change our demo to be more like the bitcoin
since i'm better at notes, organize my thoughts and notes here into a readme. modeld on the comma ai one 




vocab 
-a block is hashed when first added 

-if we don't have the nonce, we can't have proof of work. And PoW is necessary for trustless security, the whole reason for the blockchain.
